# mwaiseghe.dev-tools

Once upon a time, in a world full of scattered scripts and half-remembered commands, I decided to build **mwaiseghe.dev-tools**â€”my own magical toolbox! ðŸ§°âœ¨

Every developer has their quirks, and mine involve jumping between projects, wrangling environments, and hunting for that one script I wrote months ago. So, I thought: why not gather all my favorite tools, helpers, and shortcuts in one place? This project is my answerâ€”a fun, ever-growing collection of the utilities I use every day.

## What's inside?

- Handy scripts for common dev tasks
- Environment setup helpers
- Productivity boosters
- ...and a few surprises along the way!

## Why?

Because building tools is fun. Because I love automating the boring stuff. And because every hero needs a trusty toolkit.

## Want to join the adventure?

Feel free to fork, star, or suggest your own tools! Let's make daily development a little more magical, one script at a time. ðŸš€

Happy coding!
